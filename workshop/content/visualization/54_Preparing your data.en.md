3. We suggest that you pick two - three columns from your data set that meet the following criteria:
  * The first column is a date column (can be year, month or day. Usually marked by **calendar icon**
in **Fields list** on the left)
  * The second column is a quantifiable number (revenue, count, distance, etc. Usually
marked by a **green hash #**)
  * The third column has categorical value, which means it has specific limited set of values (type,
category, etc. Usually marked by **ticket icon**)
